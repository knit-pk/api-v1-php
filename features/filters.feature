Feature:
  In order to get resources that match my criteria
  As a client software developer
  I want to filter resource collections by their attributes

  Scenario: It receives collection of articles that belong to news category using REST
    Given I add Accept header equal to 'application/json'
    When I send a GET request to '/articles?category.code=news&group[]=CategoryRead'
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the JSON collection should not be empty
    And the JSON items in collection should have node category.code that is equal to news

  Scenario: It receives collection of articles that belong to news category using Hydra
    Given I add Accept header equal to 'application/ld+json'
    When I send a GET request to '/articles?category.code=news&group[]=CategoryRead'
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header 'Content-Type' should be equal to 'application/ld+json; charset=utf-8'
    And the JSON collection 'hydra:member' should not be empty
    And the JSON items in collection 'hydra:member' should have node 'category.code' that is equal to 'news'

  Scenario: It receives collection of articles that belong to news category using GraphQL
    Given I add Accept header equal to 'application/json'
    When I send a 'GET' request to '/graphql?query={articles(category_code:"news"){edges{node{category{code}}}}}'
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the JSON collection 'data.articles.edges' should not be empty
    And the JSON items in collection 'data.articles.edges' should have node 'node.category.code' that is equal to 'news'
